### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yevhen u can see my resume by link yevhenb.netlify.app

I studied at NAU, as a computer systems and networks. For some time I worked in a state institution as a system administrator. In recent years, I worked in a logistics company of the USA, which made it possible to deepen my knowledge of the English language. I want to gain new knowledge and realize myself as an IT specialist in a strong team.

Have a great day!!!
